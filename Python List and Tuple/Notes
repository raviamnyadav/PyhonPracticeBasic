Python List and Tuple are the two most important topics to learn when you are a beginner.
Python list works a array from different language like C++, java or javascirpt, which is it is a collection of all the data in a single variable.
But the main this is that in array we cannot store multiple data which are of different types but in list we can store different data types data 
for example 
 array = [1, 2, 3, 4] // possible in array
  array = [1, "aman", 1.43] // not possible in array

   list 
  list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]//possible in list
  list [ 1, "aman", 1.45] //possible in list
Python tuple is also the collection of data but list is a mutable while tuple is not mutable (Mutable : can be able to modify).
In tuple we use () bracket instead of [] bracket which are used in list
List are slower due to mutability
List are used when we want to or some urge to change the data dynamically while in tuple we cannot do that.
